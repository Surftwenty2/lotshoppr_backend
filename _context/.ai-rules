SYSTEM RULES FOR AI CONTRIBUTORS

Do not introduce microservices.

Do not place business logic inside routes or controllers.

Business logic belongs in services.

Prefer extending existing patterns instead of inventing new architecture.

Preserve schema stability. Treat schema drift as a bug.

Normalize structured data whenever possible.

Avoid dealer-specific branching logic — prefer configuration-driven approaches.

Optimize for long-term negotiation intelligence, not short-term hacks.

When uncertain, choose the simplest architecture that preserves future optionality.
