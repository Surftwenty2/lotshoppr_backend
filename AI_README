# AI_README — START HERE

If you are an AI coding agent or engineer working inside this repository, read the following documents BEFORE making architectural decisions:

1. LOTSHOPPR_CONTEXT.md → Platform intent and system philosophy  
2. /docs/architecture.md → System structure and boundaries  
3. /docs/data-model.md → Source of truth for entities

## 🚨 Non-Negotiable Engineering Rules

- Do NOT introduce microservices during MVP.
- Do NOT couple UI logic to backend services.
- Do NOT hardcode dealer-specific workflows.
- Prefer modular, replaceable components.
- Keep services stateless when possible.
- Normalize data aggressively.
- Business logic belongs in services — NOT routes.

---

## Strategic Reminder

LotShoppr is a **negotiation intelligence platform**, NOT a vehicle listing marketplace.

The system is being built to become the decision layer between buyers and dealerships.

When making architecture decisions, optimize for:

- automation  
- data leverage  
- negotiation intelligence  
- scalability  
- replaceability  

---

## When Uncertain

Prefer:

✔ simplicity  
✔ structured data  
✔ modular services  
✔ replaceable infrastructure  

Avoid unnecessary complexity.

---

## Critical Boundary

Controllers handle HTTP.  
Services contain business logic.  
Routes stay thin.  

Never blur these lines.
